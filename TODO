* Replace boost::lexical_cast with something else, so that last.json does not depend on Boost when C++11 libraries are available.
* Serialising a lastjson::value to a stream uses the std::dec manipulator on the stream and therefore has a side effect on the stream. This should be avoided.
* Add test cases - specifically destructive test cases, where lastjson must throw correctly.
